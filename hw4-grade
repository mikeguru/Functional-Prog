/* === Evaluation === */
/* Blackjack   	          60/60 */
Works well.

/* === Style === */
/* Modular code           20/25 */
Too much of the code was in Blackjack.hs. Next time please segement things out to form a domain modle. I also don't see why you wrote the printText and header functions in separate files. 

/* Other style features   15/15 */ 
    E.g.: 
    -code reuse
    -documentation, 
    -naming conventions
Aside from the module definitions, the code is pretty well-factored. Looking good!

/* Extra-Credit           10/10 */ 
Works.

/* _TOTAL-SCORE_    105/100 */
Nice work!
